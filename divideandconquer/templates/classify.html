	Help classify spam messages for Mozilla projects such as
	<a href="http://input.mozilla.com">input</a>
	and
	<a href="http://support.mozilla.com">kitsune</a>!
	Using your feedback we'll use machine learning to train a bayesian
	classifier to keep spam out of Mozilla projects!
	You can learn more about the bayesian classifier

*Ham is any sort of legit message, even if it's misspelled, in Polish,
or says "Fuck You". Comments like "Sex Film" are spam though.
<br><br>
Also, a lot of these comments are pretty depressing. Most of them come from
people who aren't very familiar with computers. Projects are underway to help
improve Firefox and remove toolbars and extensions which cause crashes.
